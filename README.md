#Code and materials for pyro taskforce meetings

The idea is, to jointly get into pyro, and distribute and parallelize documentation reading etc.

To get started with the code, use the environment.yml file to create a conda environment which installs all the necessary requirements to run inference with pyro, as well as plot results.

First install anaconda, open a commandline of your choice, and create the environment with
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
and activate it using
```
conda activate PyroTaskforce
```

As an editor, the environment also installs spyder, in which you can open the python files and run them.
